# Exercise 7 - Power BI integration

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will realize another benefit of the fully integrated environment provided by Azure Synapse Analytics. Here, you will create a Power BI Report and build a visualization within Synapse Analytics Studio. Once you have published a dataset, you will not have to leave this environment to log into a separate Power BI website to view and edit reports.

The Power BI Workspace has already been created for you.

## Lab Objectives

The tasks you will perform in this exercise are:

- Task 1 - Create a Power BI dataset in Synapse
- Task 2 - Create a Power BI report in Synapse
- Task 3 - View the SQL query

---

**Important**:

In the tasks below, you will be asked to enter a unique identifier in several places. You can find your unique identifier by looking at the username you were provided for logging into the Azure portal. Your username is in the format `odl_user_UNIQUEID@msazurelabs.onmicrosoft.com`, where the _UNIQUEID_ component looks like `206184`, `206137`, or `205349`, as examples.

Please locate this value and note it for the steps below.

   ![Selecting the right workspace to work on](media/ex03-enter-dataset-credentials.png "Selecting the right workspace to work on")

6. Navigate back to your Synapse workspace in the previous tab and select the **refresh** button above the Fields list in the Power BI report. After a few seconds, you should see the list of fields below. Alternatively, you may refresh your browser window.

   ![The refresh button above the fields list is highlighted.](media/ex03-pbi-refresh.1.png "Refresh")

7. Within the Power BI Designer, select **Table** under Visualizations.

   ![The visualization is highlighted.](media/pbi-01.png "Table")

8. Drag the **Profit**, **SalespersonKey** and **TotalExcludingTax**,  field into **Cloumns** field for the visualization. 

   ![The field values are displayed as described above.](media/pbi-02.png "Visualization fields")
   
9. Click on the downward arrow button next to each field in the **Columns** section and select **Don't summarize**.

   ![The field values are displayed as described above.](media/pbi-03.png "Visualization fields")
   
     >**Note**: Make sure to select **Don't summarize** aggregation for all the three fields.

10. Resize the line and clustered column chart visualization to fit the report area. Your visualization should look like the following:

     ![The visualization is highlighted on the report canvas.](media/pbi-04.png "Completed visualization")

11. Under the **Filters** pane, expand the **Profit** filter **(1)**. Select **is greater than** under `Show items when the value:` **(2)**, then enter **5000** for the value. Select **Apply filter (3)**.

    ![The filter is configured as described above.](media/pbi-05.png "Profit filter")

12. After a few seconds, you should see the visualization change based on the filter. In this case, we narrow down the results to only those where the total profit amount is greater than 5000. Since we are using Direct Query, Power BI pushed down the filter to the dedicated SQL pool (SQLPool01) to execute a new query based on the filter parameters. The pool sent back the results to Power BI to re-render the chart. Since we are dealing with a vast number of records (over 12 million), harnessing the dedicated SQL pool's power to aggregate and filter the data rather than importing them and using the Power BI engine to do the work is much more efficient.

    ![The filtered visualization is displayed.](media/pbi-06.png "Filtered visualization")

13. From the file menu within the designer, select **Save As**.

    ![Selecting Save As from the File menu](media/ex03-file-save-as.1.png "Save As")

14. In the dialog that appears, enter **Key Sales by Person** for the name, then select **Save**.

    ![The save dialog is displayed.](media/ex03-pbi-save-report.png "Save your report")

15. This report is now available to all authorized users within Synapse Analytics Studio and the Power BI workspace.

## Task 3 - View the SQL query

1. Navigate to the **Monitor** hub.

   ![Monitor hub.](media/monitor-hub.png "Monitor hub")

2. Select **SQL requests** in the left-hand menu **(1)**, then select **SQLPool01** under the Pool filter **(2)**. Look at the list of recent queries executed by your lab username as the Submitter. Hover over one of these queries to see the **Request content**, and click on **More** next to the Request content **(3)** to view the executed query.

   ![The list of SQL requests is displayed.](media/ex03-sqlrequestsid.1.png "SQL requests")

3. View the queries' request content until you find one that contains the SQL SELECT statement executed by your filter in the Power BI report. Here you can see the `Profit`, `SalespersonKey`, and `TotalExcludingTax` fields have been selected from the `wwi.FactSale`. A WHERE clause filters the rows where the value is greater than or equal to `5000`. Power BI generated the SQL script, and then used the dedicated SQL pool to execute the query and send back the results.

   ![The SQL query is displayed as described above.](media/pbi-07.png "Request content")

## Summary 

In this exercise , we explored Power BI integration within Azure Synapse Analytics. We created a Power BI dataset using Power BI Desktop, published it to the Power BI workspace, and then built a report within Synapse Analytics Studio. We utilized the dataset to visualize data and applied filters to enhance data analysis. Finally, we examined the SQL query generated by Power BI to understand how it interacted with the SQL pool. This exercise highlighted the seamless integration of Power BI within Synapse Analytics for efficient data visualization and reporting.
