# Azure Synapse Analytics in a Day Lab

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 hours

## Overview

The Azure Synapse Analytics in a Day lab is a hands-on workshop that introduces participants to the capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics, combining big data and data warehousing into a unified platform. Attendees will learn to ingest and prepare data from various sources, explore data warehousing concepts, and perform data analysis using SQL and Spark within Synapse Studio. The lab also covers integration with Power BI for interactive reporting and emphasizes security, monitoring, and best practices. Through guided exercises, participants will gain practical experience in leveraging Azure Synapse to drive data insights and enhance decision-making in an enterprise setting.

### Wide World Importers

Wide World Importers (WWI) is a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor operating from the San Francisco Bay Area.

As a wholesaler, WWI's customers are mostly companies who resell to individuals. WWI sells to retail customers across the United States, including speciality stores, supermarkets, computing stores, tourist attraction shops, and some individuals. WWI sells to other wholesalers via a network of agents who promote the products on WWI's behalf. While all of WWI's customers are currently based in the United States, the company intends to expand into other countries.

WWI buys goods from suppliers, including novelty and toy manufacturers, and other novelty wholesalers. They stock the goods in their WWI warehouse and reorder from suppliers as needed to fulfil customer orders. They also purchase large volumes of packaging materials and sell these in smaller quantities as a convenience for the customers.

Recently WWI started to sell a variety of edible novelties such as chili chocolates. The company previously did not have to handle chilled items. To meet food handling requirements, they must monitor the temperature in their chiller room and any of their trucks that have chiller sections.

### Lab context

Wide World Importers is designing and implementing a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a unified data analytics platform. Their soft goal is to bring siloed teams to work together on a single platform.

In this guided-lab, you will play the role of various persons: a data engineer, a business analyst, and a data scientist. The workspace is already set up to focus on some of the core development capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics.

By the end of this lab, you will have performed a non-exhaustive list of operations that combine the strength of Big Data and SQL analytics into a single platform.
